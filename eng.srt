1
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,140
Can she hear us?

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,400
OK, great.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,880
Can we call her Mina?

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,060
[Speaker 2] OK.

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,820
[Speaker 1] Then
let's get started.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,792
The first question is, why does
she have to hide her identity?

7
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:41,210
[Speaker 2] I don't show
my face because I don't

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,790
want people to recognize me.

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,340
It's too risky.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,480
The consequences
could be terrible.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,660
I'd also be putting my
whole family in danger.

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,310
talk openly about politics.

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,630
If you say something the
authorities don't like,

14
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,825
you're in serious trouble.

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,900
I don't want to
reveal my identity.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,480
by the Iranian dictatorship.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,990
Even prison hasn't stopped
them from speaking out.

18
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,640
Narges Mohammadi was detained
for defending human rights.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,540
She managed to send
us this letter.

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,180
(NON-ENGLISH SPEECH)

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,560
We've seen grainy video
of her on some security

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,950
camera collapsing in some
sort of holding room.

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,870
The people of
Iran took the risk

24
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,860
of filming these
videos themselves,

25
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,420
so that the entire world
could see what was happening.

26
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,410
We heard their clamor for we've
all experienced a revolution

27
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,616
in our own histories.

28
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:16,452
(MUSIC PLAYING)

29
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,015
I felt like I'd lost
a family member.

30
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,690
What if it'd be me?

31
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,850
And supposing it had
happened to someone close

32
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,470
to me, what would
have happened?

33
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,950
We were extremely sad until
the demonstration started,

34
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,525
and people began to protest.

35
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,164
gave us strength and hope.

36
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,300
a spontaneous demonstration.

37
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,130
For the first time, women
were leading the protest.
