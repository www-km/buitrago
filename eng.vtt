00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.988

3
00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:12.320

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.240

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.140
Can she hear us?

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.400
OK, great.

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.880
Can we call her Mina?

11
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.060
[Speaker 2] OK.

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.820
[Speaker 1] Then
let's get started.

13
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.792
The first question is, why does
she have to hide her identity?

14
00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.210
[Speaker 2] I don't show
my face because I don't

15
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.790
want people to recognize me.

16
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.340
It's too risky.

17
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.480
The consequences
could be terrible.

18
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.660
I'd also be putting my
whole family in danger.

19
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.144

21
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.310
talk openly about politics.

22
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.630
If you say something the
authorities don't like,

23
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.825
you're in serious trouble.

24
00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.340

26
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.900
I don't want to
reveal my identity.

27
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.612

29
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.480
by the Iranian dictatorship.

30
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.990
Even prison hasn't stopped
them from speaking out.

31
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.640
Narges Mohammadi was detained
for defending human rights.

32
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.540
She managed to send
us this letter.

33
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.180
(NON-ENGLISH SPEECH)

34
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.180

42
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.560
We've seen grainy video
of her on some security

43
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.950
camera collapsing in some
sort of holding room.

44
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.950

49
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.870
The people of
Iran took the risk

50
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.860
of filming these
videos themselves,

51
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.420
so that the entire world
could see what was happening.

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.410
We heard their clamor for we've
all experienced a revolution

53
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.616
in our own histories.

54
00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:16.452
(MUSIC PLAYING)

55
00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:23.452

60
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.015
I felt like I'd lost
a family member.

61
00:03:48.015 --> 00:03:51.190

63
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.690
What if it'd be me?

64
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.850
And supposing it had
happened to someone close

65
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.470
to me, what would
have happened?

66
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.950
We were extremely sad until
the demonstration started,

67
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.525
and people began to protest.

68
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:13.710

70
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.164
gave us strength and hope.

71
00:04:17.164 --> 00:04:20.133

73
00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:24.390

75
00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:34.696

78
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.300
a spontaneous demonstration.

79
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.130
For the first time, women
were leading the protest.

80
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.130
